                <h2>Welcome to AutoHQ, Your Trusted Automotive Community</h2>
                <p>At AutoHQ, we live and breathe cars. Founded in 2010 by a group of passionate car enthusiasts, our forum has grown into one of the most respected online communities for automotive lovers around the world. What started as a small online gathering of friends sharing their love for vehicles has evolved into a vibrant hub where thousands of members come together to discuss everything on wheels.</p>

                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>AutoHQ was born from a simple idea: to create a place where people from all walks of life could share their passion for automobiles, exchange knowledge, and help each other navigate the complexities of car ownership. Our founders—Jake Thompson, Maria Ramirez, and Alex Wu—were lifelong friends who bonded over a shared love of classic cars and long road trips.</p>
                <p>Jake, a professional mechanic with over 20 years of experience, Maria, an automotive journalist with a knack for spotting industry trends, and Stefan and Todor, software engineers with a vision for building online communities, pooled their talents to create AutoHQ. Their goal was to establish a forum that wasn't just about cars, but also about the people who love them.</p>
